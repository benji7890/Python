### Objectives:

Prints an empty field at the beginning of the game.

Suppose the bottom left cell has the coordinates (1, 1) and the top right cell has the coordinates (3, 3) like in this table:

(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)

The program should ask to enter the coordinates where the user wants to make a move.
Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a field with the changes if everything is ok.

The program should ask to enter the coordinates where the user wants to make a move.
Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.
